You will need to collect the following body parts to your lab, as well as the correct materials.
You need to collect a right arm, a left arm, a left leg, a right leg, as well as the torso and head of your monster.
You need to gain a needle and thread to also properly assemble the monster. 
Don't forget about the foes on your way who also covet the body parts you seek, and good luck.""",

Its irregular shape, adorned with whimsical patterns, seems to evoke a perpetual grin on my face. I picked it up on a whim,

but the sheer quirkiness of this geological oddity has ensnared my fascination. I've tried to set it down, but it exerts a magnetic pull on my hand, 
tugging at my curiosity and igniting my imagination with endless tales of its origin.
